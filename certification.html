				<h2>Certification</h2>
				
				<p>The DAISY Consortium certifies organizations who have demonstrated that they have the knowledge, processes
					and procedures in place to check EPUB publications against the accessibility requirements of the EPUB Accessibility
					specification.</p>
				
				<p>In order to become certified, applicants are required to provide detailed information on how their processes and workflows
					ensure that all aspects of conformance are covered. As every workflow is unique, the DAISY Consortium does not
					define specific testing requirements. This tool has been developed to highlight the key areas of the specification, and
					all applicants will need to show how they cover each area. A publisher might include quality checks within their publishing
					workflow, for example, and only spot check content at the end, while a third-party evaluator would need to demonstrate the
					thoroughness of their quality assurance testing on the final products they receive.</p>
				
				<p>All applicants will be required to provide samples of work they have evaluated and their reporting practices. In the case
					of organizations, training and evaluation procedures will also be required to ensure that staff turnover does not affect
					their ability to carry out proper evaluations.</p>
				
				<p>The DAISY Consortium does not warrant the evaluations or services provided by any certified individual or organization.</p>
