				<h2>Automated Inspection</h2>
				
				<p>You will typically use the SMART tool together with the Ace automated accessibility checker, with Ace
					run first to discover any issues that can be detected by machine.
				
				<div class="note" role="note">
					<p><strong>Note</strong>: Information on how to install and use Ace is available from the <a
						href="https://inclusivepublishing.org/toolbox/accessibility-checker/getting-started/">Inclusive
						Publishing site</a>.</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>If you are fixing an EPUB publication, you should continue running Ace until it does not report any
					more errors before moving on to the SMART tool. If you are only creating a report about the
					publication, you do not need to fix the issues as they will be imported into the SMART tool.</p>
				
				<p>Aside from its use checking for errors, the Ace tool is important to run first because it produces a
					data file named <code>report.json</code>. This file contains information about the EPUB publication
					and any issues in it. It is also the one that will be loaded into the SMART interface to prepare
					the manual evaluation process. Without this file, you will have to start a blank evaluation and
					manually add all the necessary information about the publication.</p>
				
				<p>Do not discard the <code>report.html</code> file that Ace also produces, as it contains additional
					information that helps expedite certain manual inspection processes (e.g., checking whether images
					are decorative or have meaningful alternative texts).</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note">
					<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using the Ace graphical user interface, you will need to use
						the Export option to obtain these files.</p>
