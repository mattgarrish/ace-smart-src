				<h2>Overview</h2>
				
				<p>Evaluating EPUB publications for accessibility is a two-step process:</p>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>1. Automated Inspection</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The first step is to ensure the publication passes automated testing, which is accomplished
							using the following tools:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck/releases">epubcheck</a> &#8212; The first
								step in automated verification is to use the epubcheck validator to check for errors.
								Although this tool does not specifically perform accessibility checks, it ensures that
								publications are valid, which is necessary to pass WCAG success criterion 4.1.1.</li>

							<li><a href="https://github.com/daisy/ace-core/releases">Ace</a> &#8212; The next step is to
								use Ace validator to verify accessibility requirements that can be programmatically
								determined.</li>
						</ol>
					</dd>

					<dt>2. Manual Inspection</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although automated validation tools will alert you to problems that can be programmatically
							determined, there are many aspects of accessibility that a tool cannot verify (quality of
							descriptions, scripting accessibility, keyboard issues, etc.). The second step in verifying
							the accessibility of an EPUB publication is therefore to perform these additional manual
							checks &#8212; a claim of conformance cannot be made only from automated testing.</p>
						
						<p>The Ace SMART tool is designed to help you perform manual assessments.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<p>Note that to carry out an evaluation, you will require editing software that allows you to review
					the resources of the publication is required. This is true even if you are only reporting issues
					and not fixing them, as you need access to the raw markup of the publication to verify many
					accessibility requirements.</p>
				
				<p>The EPUB publication you are evaluating does not have to be zipped to carry out the manual
					evaluation steps, as zipping does not directly affect the accessibility.</p>
