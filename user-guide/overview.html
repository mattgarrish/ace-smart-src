				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>There are two steps in the accessibility evaluation process for EPUB publications:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>1. Automated Verification</dt>

					<dd>
						<p>The first step is to ensure the publication passes automated testing:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Use the <a href="https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck/releases">epubcheck</a> validator to check
								the publication for errors to the EPUB specification. Although this tool does not
								specifically perform accessibility checks, it ensures the publication is a valid EPUB
								publication, which is necessary to pass WCAG success criterion 4.1.1.</li>

							<li>Use the <a href="https://github.com/daisy/ace-core/releases">DAISY Ace</a> accessibility tool
								to check accessibility requirements that can be programmatically determined.</li>
						</ol>
					</dd>

					<dt>2. Manual Verification</dt>

					<dd>
						<p>Although automated validation tools will alert you to problems that can be programmatically
							determined, ensuring accessibility conformance also requires a number of manual checks. There are
							many aspects of accessibility that a tool cannot verify (quality of descriptions, scripting
							accessibility, keyboard issues, etc.). These checks must be performed to ensure conformance with
							the EPUB Accessibility specification &#8212; a claim of conformance cannot be made only from
							automated testing.</p>
						<p>This site is configured to help you perform these manual assessments, sometimes using the output
							from the Ace tool to simplify verification.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>Note that in order to carry out an evaluation, editing software that allows you to review the resources of
					the publication is required. This is true even if you are only reporting issues and not fixing them, as
					you need access to the raw markup of the publication to verify many accessibility requirements.</p>
				<p>The EPUB publication does not have to be zipped to carry out the manual evaluation steps, as zipping does
					not directly affect the accessibility. The publication does need to be zipped for the Ace automatic
					reporting tool to perform its evaluation at this time, however.</p>
