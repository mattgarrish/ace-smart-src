				<h2>Configuring an Evaluation</h2>
				
				<p>To ensure that a publication is accessible, you need to manually go through and verify each
					conformance requirement. The Conformance Verification tab provides a list of these requirements for
					each WCAG success criterion and each additional EPUB requirement.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<figcaption>Figure 1 &#8212; The Conformance tab is the second in the tab bar. It contains the list
						of success criteria that must be passed to claim conformance, as well as options for customizing
						the list.</figcaption>
					<img src="images/tab_conformance.png" width="600" alt="Conformance tab" />
				</figure>
				
				<p>The first thing you need to decide when starting an evaluation is which version of the EPUB
					Accessibility specification you want the publication to conform to.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<figcaption>Figure 2 &#8212; The EPUB version selection box allows you to choose the version of the
						specification to conform to.</figcaption>
					<img src="images/epub_version.png" width="250" alt="EPUB version" />
				</figure>
				
				<p>It is always recommended to use the latest version unless there is a specific need to use an older
					one (e.g., if national regulations require conformance to a version). The SMART tool will always
					set the latest version by default.</p>
				
				<p>The next two options allow you to set the WCAG conformance requirement for the publication.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<figcaption>Figure 2 &#8212; The WCAG selection boxes options allow you to select the version and
						level.</figcaption>
					<img src="images/wcag_config.png" width="350" alt="WCAG options" />
				</figure>
				
				<p>The SMART tool defaults to verify that publications meet the latest WCAG version at Level AA. Note
					that the EPUB Accessibility 1.0 specification only endorsed conformance to WCAG 2.0. If you select
					that version, it will not be possible to change the WCAG version from 2.0 (the selection box is
					disabled).</p>
				
				<div class="note">
					<p><strong>Note</strong>: The reporting tool does not include the option to conform to level AAA as
						this level is more aspirational than achievable.</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>As you select the different possible conformance options, the SMART tool automatically updates the
					list of applicable success criteria. These changes include adding or removing success criteria,
					depending on which version they were introduced in, and changing the level of some criteria
					(e.g., WCAG 2.2 changes some criteria from AA to A).</p>
				
				
				<section id="view">
					<h3>Additional Options</h3>
					
					<p>The SMART tool also contains a set of options for further customizing the success criteria
						to more specific needs</p>
					
					<p>To view these options, you must click on the Additional Options link after the configuration
						settings opens.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<figcaption>Figure 3 &#8212; The Additional Options dialog box contains more settings to
							control the display and status of the success criteria.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/additional_options.png" width="550" alt="Additional options" />
					</figure>
					
					<p>The following list describes each of the options provided in the dialog:</p> 
					
					<dl>
						<dt id="sc-excl"><dfn>Exclude tests for</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>The "Exclude tests for" field allows you to hide content-specific success criteria if
								you know that they do not apply to the publication (e.g., audio, video, and scripting
								requirements).</p>
							
							<p>These options are automatically set to reflect the content when the 
								<a href="load-ace.html">Ace JSON report is loaded</a>.</p>
							
							<p>Note that selecting any of these options only hides the related criteria from view.
								The criteria are still included in the generated report with a "not applicable"
								status.</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt id="sc-opt"><dfn>Show optional criteria</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>The "Show optional criteria" field allows you to also view success criteria above the
								level you are checking the publication against. For example, if you are checking
								against WCAG Level AA, you could check the AAA option to have those success
								criteria displayed.</p>
					
							<p>Showing these optional criteria does not change the conformance level being verified,
								and their status is not used in calculating conformance to that level. What showing
								the criteria does is allow you to indicate that a publication meets requirements
								beyond the base level being tested (i.e., any optional criteria you verify are included
								in the final report).</p>
						</dd>
							
						<dt id="sc-filter"><dfn>Hide success criteria with status</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This option allows you to temporarily hide all success criteria whose status is set to
								one of the specified values.</p>
							
							<p>You can use this option, for example to completely hide success criteria that are not
								applicable, or to hide all but failures or unverified success criteria to review them
								faster.</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt id="sc-global-status"><dfn>Set all success criteria to</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Clicking on one of the status values in this field will set all success criteria to that
								value, no matter their current status.</p>
							
							<p>It is strongly recommended not to use this option as there is no way to undo a change
								except to not save the result and reload the report to its last saved status.</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt id="sc-show-descriptions"><dfn>Success criteria descriptions</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This option allows you to hide the descriptions that explain what needs to be checked
								for each success criteria. Only the success criteria name and status section
								are visible when selected.</p>
							
							<p>This field is a convenience for advanced evaluators with strong knowledge of the
								success criteria requirements.</p>
