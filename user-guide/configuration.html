				<h2>Configuring an Evaluation</h2>
				<p>In order to ensure that a publication is accesible, you need to manually go through and verify each
					conformance requirement. The Conformance Verification tab provides a list of these requirements for
					each WCAG success criterion and each additional EPUB requirement.</p>
				<p>Not all of the conformance criteria are applicable to every publication, however, so the Conformance
					Verification tab begins with a set of options that allow you to simplify the list to only those
					criteria you need to check.</p>
				<p>The first of these options lets you set the WCAG level to check the publication against. Conformance
					Verification tab is configured by default to verify that publications meets WCAG Level AA
					requirements, so all Level A and AA success criteria are displayed.</p>

					 />
				</figure>
				<p>To check Level A conformance instead, simply switch the setting. The list of success criteria
					automatically updates to match the selected setting (i.e., all the Level AA criteria are
					hidden).</p>
				<div class="note">
					<p><strong>Note</strong>: The reporting tool does not include the option to conform to level AAA as
						this level is more aspirational than achievable.</p>
				</div>
				<p>The next field provides you the option to also list success criteria above the level you are checking
					the publication against. For example, if you are checking against WCAG Level AA, you could check the
					AAA option to also have those success criteria included.</p>
				<figure>

				</figure>
				<p>Showing these optional criteria does not change the conformance level being verified, and their
					status is not used in calculating conformance to that level. What showing the criteria does is allow
					you to indicate that a publication meets requirements beyond the base level being tested (i.e., any
					optional criteria you verify are included in the final report).</p>
				<p>It is also possible to hide content-specific success criteria if you know that they do not apply to
					the publication (e.g., scripting requirements).</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/criteria_options.png" width="450"
						alt="Checkboxes for images, audio, video, scripting, and forms elements" />
				</figure>
				<p>These options are automatically updated to reflect the content when the <a href="load-ace.html">Ace
						JSON report is loaded</a>.</p>
				<p>Note that deselecting any of these options only hides the related criteria from view. The criteria
					are still included in the generated report with a "not applicable" status.</p>
				<section id="view">
					<h3>View Options</h3>
					<p>Clicking on "Additional View options" reveals a set of useful tools that you can use to better
						tailor the success criteria to your evaluation needs.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/sc_view_options.png" width="600" alt="Expanded list of view options" />
					</figure>
					<p>A general description of each of these options follows:</p>
					<dl>
						<dt id="sc-filter"><dfn>Hide success criteria with status</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This option allows you to temporarily hide all success criteria whose status has been set
								to one of the specified values. This option allows you to quickly review all failures,
								for example, or find which success criteria have not been verified or are set to not
								applicable.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="sc-global-status"><dfn>Set all success criteria to</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>It is strongly recommended not to use this option unless absolutely needed. Picking one
								of the status values will set all success criteria to that value, no matter their
								current status.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="sc-show-descriptions"><dfn>Success criteria descriptions</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This option is a convenience for advanced evaluators with a strong knowledge of the
								success criteria requirements. It is used to hide the descriptions that explain what
								needs to be checked for each success criteria. Only the success criteria name and status
								are visible if selected.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="sc-show-help-links"><dfn>Help links</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This option is a convenience for new evaluators. It is used to automatically expand all
								the help link sections (i.e., the links to the knowledge base and to additional WCAG
								help documents). These sections are collapsed by default to avoid cluttering the
								interface.</p>
						</dd>
