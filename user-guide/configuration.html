				<h2>Configuring an Evaluation</h2>
				<p>The primary step in evaluating a publication is to verify it meets all the required conformance
					requirements. The Conformance Verification tab provides a list of requirements that must be passed for
					each WCAG success criterion and each additional EPUB requirement.</p>
				<p>The Conformance Verification tab is configured by default to verify that publications meets WCAG Level
					AA requirements.</p>

					/>
				</figure>
				<p>To check Level A conformance instead, simply switch the setting. The list of success criteria
					automatically updates to match the selected setting.</p>
				<div class="note">
					<p><strong>Note</strong>: The reporting tool does not include the option to conform to level AAA as
						this level is more aspirational than achievable.</p>
				</div>
				<p>The next field allows you to add WCAG Level AA and AAA success criteria to the list to check.</p>
				<figure>

				</figure>
				<p>Showing these criteria does not change the conformance level being verified, and their status is not
					used in calculating the overall conformance. Showing the criteria simply allows you to indicate that
					a publication meets requirements beyond the base level being tested. Only criteria set to pass or
					fail are listed in the final report.</p>
				<p>It is also possible to hide content-specific success criteria if you know that they do not apply to
					the publication (e.g., scripting requirements).</p>
				<figure>

				</figure>
				<p>These options are automatically updated to reflect the content when the Ace JSON report is loaded in
					the <a href="setup.html">setup step</a>.</p>
				<p>Note that deselecting an option only hides the related criteria from view. The criteria are still
					included in the generated report with a "not applicable" status.</p>

					<h3>View Options</h3>
					<p>Clicking on "Additional View options" reveals a set of useful tools that you can use to better
						tailor the success criteria to your evaluation needs.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/sc_view_options.png" width="600"
							alt="Expanded list of view options"/>
					</figure>
					<p>A general description of each of these options follows:</p>
					<dl>
						<dt id="sc-filter"><dfn>Hide success criteria with status</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This option allows you to temporarily hide all success criteria whose status has
								been set to one of the specified values. This option allows you to quickly review
								all failures, for example, or find which success criteria have not been verified
								or are set to not applicable.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="sc-global-status"><dfn>Set all success criteria to</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>It is strongly recommended not to use this option unless absolutely needed (i.e., do not
								use it to set all success criteria to pass and then check whether they actually pass). Picking
								one of the status values will set all success criteria to that value, no matter their current
								status.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="sc-show-descriptions"><dfn>Success criteria descriptions</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This option is a convenience for advanced evaluators with a strong knowledge of the success
								criteria requirements. It is used to hide the description that explains what needs to
								be checked for each success criteria, so that only the success criteria name and status
								are visible.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="sc-show-help-links"><dfn>Help links</dfn></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This option is a convenience for new evaluators. It is used to automatically expand
								the help link sections in each success criteria (i.e., the links to the knowledge base
								and to additional WCAG help documents). These sections are collapsed by default.</p>
						</dd>
