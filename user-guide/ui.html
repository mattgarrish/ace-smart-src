				<h2>The SMART User Interface</h2>
				
				<p>The SMART application is designed to make it easy to work your way through the evaluation process.
					This section highlights the key areas of the application itself and how you will interact with
					them.</p>
				
				<section id="header">
					<h3>Header Controls</h3>
					
					<p>At the top right of the page are a set of general site controls.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<figcaption>Figure 1 &#8212; User profile information is followed by a logout button.
							Beneath these, in the application bar, are buttons to validate, save and
							close.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/user_controls.png" width="250" alt="User controls" />
					</figure>
					
					<p>These controls provide the following functionality:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Log in info &#8212; in addition to identifying the account you logged in under, you can
							click on your username to <a href="user-management.html">modify your user details</a>.</li>
						
						<li>Log out &#8212; clicking this button will end your session and exit you from the SMART
							tool.</li>
						
						<li>Validate &#8212; clicking this button will have the SMART tool check that all necessary
							fields have been completed and that there are no input errors.</li>
						
						<li>Close &#8212; clicking this button will close the current evaluation and return you to the
							application starting page (i.e., where you can start a new evaluation and view your
							evaluation history).</li>
						
						<li>Save &#8212; clicking the save button <a href="eval-save.html">saves your current
								evaluation</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section id="tabs">
					<h3>Body Tabs</h3>
					
					<p>The body of the SMART interface is composed of a set of tabs, each of which handles a specific
						aspect of accessibility conformance and reporting.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<figcaption>Figure 2 &#8212; Tab bar includes tabs for Publication Info, Conformance, Discovery, 
							Distribution, Result, and Reporting. The active tab is indicated by a blue bar above its
							name.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/tabs.png" width="600" alt="SMART Tabs"/>
					</figure>
					
					<p>In a typical evaluation, you will work your way through each of these tabs one at a time, but you
						are free to jump around and review the information in any order. For example, you might prefer
						to verify the discovery and distribution metadata before beginning the process of verifying
						conformance.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="errors">
					<h3>Message Panel</h3>
					
					<p>The message panel appears at the bottom of the SMART interface whenever issues are found during
						validation. You can manually validate an evaluation using the "Validate" button at the top of
						the SMART interface, but automatic validation occurs whenever you generate metadata or
						reports.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<figcaption>Figure 3 &#8212; The message panel is separated from the main content by a black
							bar with the title Validation Messages.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/message_panel.png" width="700" alt="SMART message panel"/>
					</figure>
					
					<p>The panel contains a list of validation warnings and errors that were discovered. The severity of
						each message is indicated in square brackets at the start.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<figcaption>Figure 4 &#8212; Error messages are prefaced by the text "[ERROR]".</figcaption>
						<img src="images/error_message.png" width="400" alt="Error message"/>
					</figure>
					
					<div class="note">
						<p><strong>Note</strong>: While warnings may be ignored if they are determined not to apply,
							errors should always be corrected before publishing a report or using the metadata the tool
							generates in an EPUB.</p>
					</div>
					
					<p>To go to the location of the warning or error, click on its message. Errors and warnings are also
						distinguished visually in each tab by red and yellow backgrounds, respectively. The
							<code>aria-invalid</code> attribute is also used to convey this information to assistive
						technologies.</p>
					
					<p>To close the message panel, click the X button in the left-hand corner.</p>
					
					<p>To re-open the message panel, press <code>ctrl+m</code> or re-run the metadata or report
						generation operation you were trying to perform.</p>
