				<h2>Loading the Ace JSON Report</h2>
				<p>To prepare this site to evaluate a publication, it is first necessary to load the JSON report output
					by the Ace tool. This report is in the file called <code>report.json</code>. It is not the HTML file
					that you use to review the issues found by that tool.</p>
				<p>To load the JSON file, you can drag it from your file system and drop it in the blue box in the Start
					tab:</p>

				</figure>
				<p>If you are not able to drag and drop the report, it is also possible to select it from the file
					system.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/json_select.png" width="250"
						alt="Within the drag and drop area is a link to a file selection dialog." />
				</figure>
				<p>Loading the report through the drag-and-drop field sends the selected file to the SMART server,
					however no information about your publication is stored (the data is simply read and returned to the
					application, as JavaScripts cannot read local files).</p>
				<p>If you prefer not to send the Ace report over the internet, a local file loading option is also
					provided.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/local_load_field.png" width="600"
						alt="Below the drag and drop area is a link to a local file load field. Expanding
						reveals a text box where the report can be pasted." />
				</figure>
				<div class="caution">
					<p><strong>Caution</strong>: When using the local loading option, avoid opening the JSON file in
						word processing applications, like Microsoft Word, that may reformat the text. Changes to the
						quote characters (e.g., switching to curly quotes) will prevent the data from loading.</p>
				</div>
				<p>Regardless of which file loading method you choose, the SMART tool will attempt to customize itself
					based on the information in the provided report. When it completes, an alert will be generated
					indicating what optimizations have been made, if any.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/ace_alert.png" width="400"
						alt="The alert shows which content type checks have been disabled followed by a
						list of inferred discovery metadata." />
				</figure>
				<div class="note">
					<p><strong>Note</strong>: If automatic detection results in incorrect tests being disabled, they can
						be re-enabled in the <a href="conformance.html">Conformance Verification tab</a>.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="note">
					<p><strong>Note</strong>: If accessibility metadata is already present in the publication, the SMART
						tool will not attempt to infer additional metadata.</p>
				</div>
				<p>If you need to review the load report again after closing the dialog, click on the link below the load
					box.</p>

						alt="The link to re-open the load report becomes active after the dialog is closed." />
