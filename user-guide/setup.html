				<h2>Evaluation Setup</h2>
				
				<section id="ace-load">
					<h3>Loading the Ace JSON Report</h3>
					
					<p>To prepare this site to evaluate a publication, it is first necessary to load the JSON report output by the Ace 
						automated tool. This report is in the file called <code>ace.json</code>. It is not the HTML file that you use 
						to review the issues found by that tool.</p>
					
					<p>To load the JSON file, you can drag it from your file system and drop it in the blue box in the Start tab:</p>
					
					<figure>
						<figcaption>The drag and drop area is shaded blue and surrounded by a dashed border.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/dnd.png" width="600" alt="" />
					</figure>
					
					<p>If you're not able to drag and drop the report, it is also possible to select it from the file system.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<figcaption>Within the drag and drop area is a link to a file selection dialog.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/json-select.png" width="250" alt="" />
					</figure>
					
					<p>The reporting tool will attempt to load the JSON report and customize itself based on the information
						it provides. When it completes, an alert will be generated indicating what optimizations have been made,
						if any.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<figcaption>The alert shows that checks for images, audio and video have been turned off.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/ace-alert.png" width="400" alt="" />
					</figure>
					
					<p>If automatic detection results in incorrect tests being disabled, they can always be re-enabled by going
						to the <a href="#configure">configuration tab</a>.</p>
					
					<div class="note">
						<p><strong>Note</strong>: The process for loading an Ace report is the same as for loading a 
							<a href="manage.html">saved report</a>.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section id="epub-config">
					<h3>EPUB Format Configuration</h3>
					
					<p>A field to select the format of the EPUB publication is located below the report loading box.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="images/epub_format.png" width="330" alt="EPUB format configuration with options for EPUB 2 and 3" />
					</figure>
					
					<p>The format selected does not change the evaluation criteria, but it does control optional metadata
						that can be generated from the tool (i.e., discovery and conformance metadata for the package document).
						It is also the reported format of the publication in the final report.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="wcag-config">
					<h3>WCAG Configuration</h3>
					
					<p>The reporting tool is configured by default to verify that publications meets WCAG Level A requirements.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="images/wcag_config.png" width="430" alt="WCAG conformance configuration with options for levels A and AA and a link to additional configuration settings" />
					</figure>
					
					<p>To check for Level AA conformance, simply switch the setting. The list of success criteria to verify  
						in the next step automatically updates to match the selected setting.</p>
					
					<p>The first section allows you to WCAG Level AA and AAA success criteria to the conformance verification tab.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="images/wcag_optional_config.png" width="250" alt="Configure button followed by save and load buttons" />
					</figure>
					
					<p>Showing these criteria does not change the conformance level being verified, and their status is not checked 
						when the final report is generated. Showing them allows you to indicate that a publication meets requirements
						beyond the base level being tested. If any of these criteria are set to pass or fail, they will be included
						in the final report.</p>
					
					<div class="note">
						<p><strong>Note</strong>: To change the WCAG conformance level the publication has to meet, use the 
							<a href="setup.html#wcag-config">options on the Start tab</a>.</p>
					</div>
					
					<p>It is also possible to hide content-specific success criteria if you know that they do not apply to the
						publication (e.g., scripting requirements).</p>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="images/criteria_options.png" width="450" alt="Checkboxes for images, audio, video, scripting, and forms elements" />
					</figure>
					
					<p>These options are automatically updated to reflect the content when the Ace JSON report is loaded in the 
						<a href="setup.html">setup step</a>.</p>
					
					<p>Note that deselecting an option only hides the related criteria from view. The criteria are still included in 
						the generated report with a "not applicable" status.</p>
					
					<div>
						<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The reporting tool does not include the option to conform to level AAA, as no content can
							realistically conform to all the requirements of this level.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section id="pubinfo">
					<h3>Publication Information</h3>
					
					<p>The final section on the Start tab is dedicated to metadata about the publication. This section can be skipped if
						you do not intend to generate a final report, otherwise you need to provide at least the title of the publication.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="images/pub-meta.png" width="600" alt="Text inputs for title, last modified date, authors, identifier and publisher" />
					</figure>
					
					<p>The title, author(s), identifier, publisher and last modified dates are all used to accurately identify the 
						publication being reported on.</p>
					
					<p>In addition to the provided fields, it is also possible to add optional metadata using the text box at the end of
						the form. To add optional metadata, type a human-readable label followed by a colon and space and then add the
						value.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="images/pub-meta-optional.png" width="600" alt="Optional metadata box contains the text 'Subject: whaling'" />
					</figure>
					
					<div class="note">
						<p><strong>Note</strong>: As the optional metadata is for human consumption, it is not recommended to use property names (e.g., use a label
							like "Created On" instead of "dcterms:created").</p>
