				<h2>Managing Reports</h2>
				
				<p>There are going to be times when you are not able to complete an evaluation at the same time that you
					initiate it. At the same time, whenever you close down your browser, any unsaved information is lost. To
					avoid having to leave your computer running to work around this dilemma, the reporting tool provides two
					options to save and reload in-progress reports:</p>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>Local storage in the browser</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>If your browser supports local storage, it is possible to save the report in the browser. Local
							storage is the easiest option, as all you have to do is click the Save/Load buttons, but it comes
							with one caveat: you need to be careful that data in local storage is not cleaned automatically. For
							example, if you are using a private browsing session (e.g., Chrome Incognito mode), any information
							you store is lost when you close the browser. Similarly, if you run a program to clean up computer
							space, the program might delete all information in local storage.</p>
						
						<p>it is recommended to save a copy to file the first few times you use this option until you can be
							sure there is no risk of data loss.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Saving to a file</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Saving to file is the safest method for storing a report for later, but also requires more steps.
							When you select this option, a new window will open with the JSON-encoded report data. You can either
							save this entire page to disk or copy the JSON data from the text field and save it using a text
							editor. Do not use a word processor, like Microsoft Word, to save the data, as it may reformat the
							text and break the JSON encoding.</p>
					
						<div class="caution">
							<p>Caution: Do not bookmark the HTML page with the expectation that you can return to it later to
								retrieve your data. It is a temporary page. Your report data will no longer be available when you
								return.</p>
						 </div>
						 
						<p>When you reload the report, you will be prompted to paste the saved data. <em>Only copy the JSON
							data.</em> If you saved the generated HTML page that includes the JSON data, do not copy the HTML
							source or any of the surrounding text on the page.</p>
					</dd>
