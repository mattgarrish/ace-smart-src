				<h2>Managing Reports</h2>
				
				<p>There are going to be times when you are not able to complete an evaluation at the same time that you
					initiate it. Similarly, any time have to close down your browser during the day, any unsaved information
					is lost. To avoid having to leave your browser open and computer running to work around this dilemma,
					the reporting tool provides two options to save and reload in-progress reports:</p>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>Local storage in the browser</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>If your browser supports local storage, it is possible to save the report in the browser. Local
							storage is the easiest option, as is doesn't involve copying and pasting data.</p>
						
						<div class="caution">
							<p><strong>Caution</strong>: Ensure that data in local storage is not cleaned automatically. For '
								example, if you are using a private browsing session (e.g., Chrome Incognito mode), any 
								information you store is lost when you close the browser. Similarly, if you run a program to
								clean up computer space, the program might delete all information in local storage. It is
								recommended to save a copy to file the first few times you use this option until you can be
								sure there is no risk of data loss.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="note">
							<p><strong>Note</strong>: It is not currently possible to save more than one active report to local storage. If there is already
								a saved report, you will be prompted to overwrite it.</p>
						</div>
					</dd>

					<dt>Saving to a file</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Saving to file is the safest method for storing a report for later, but also requires more steps.
							When you select this option, a new window will open with the JSON-encoded report data. You can
							either save this entire page to disk or copy the JSON data from the text field and save it using
							a text editor. Do not use a word processor, like Microsoft Word, to save the data, as it may
							reformat the text and break the JSON encoding.</p>
						
						<div class="caution">
							<p><strong>Caution</strong>: Do not bookmark the HTML page with the expectation that you can return
								to it later to retrieve your data. It is a temporary page. Your report data will no longer be
								available when you return.</p>
						</div>
						
						<p>When you reload the report, you will be prompted to paste the saved data. <em>Only copy the JSON
								data.</em> If you saved the generated HTML page that includes the JSON data, do not copy the
							HTML source or any of the surrounding text on the page.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<p>To save the current report, click the Save button at the top of the page.</p>

				<p>A new dialog will open with options for saving to local storage or your file system.</p>

				</figure>
				
				<p>Choose your preferred storage method (see above), and click the Save button.</p>
				
				<p>To remove an old report from local storage. Click the Clear button.</p>
				
				<p>The process to load a report is nearly identical to saving. Click the Restore button and a similar dialog will open.</p>
