				<h2>Verifying Conformance</h2>
				
				<p>The next, and primary, step in manually evaluating the publication is to check the required conformance
					requirements. The <a href="index.html#verification">Conformance Verification</a> tab provides a list of
					requirements that must be passed for each WCAG success criterion and each additional EPUB
					requirement.</p>
				
				<p>You will need to step through each success criterion and check that it is satisfied by the content. Each 
					criterion includes a status section to simplify tracking the overall conformance, and to facilitate <a href="#generate"
						>generating a report</a> at the end of the evaluation.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<figcaption>The status section appears after the links to the supporting documentation and includes pass,
						fail and not applicable options.</figcaption>
					<img src="images/status_unverified.png" width="330" alt="" />
				</figure>
				
				<p>The following list describes each of the status options.</p>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="unverified">Unverified</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>All success criteria are set to <i>unverified</i> by default, although this status may be changed
							when the Ace JSON report is loaded and analyzed (e.g., some criteria might be set to <a
								href="#na">not applicable</a>).</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/status_unverified.png" width="330"
								alt="Status section showing the unverified option set" />
						</figure>
						<p>All success criteria for the conformance level specified in the <a href="setup.html">evaluation
								setup</a> must be changed to one of the following status options prior to generating the
							final report. Failure to do so will result in a validation error. Note that Level AAA success
							criteria may be left unverified, in which case they will not be included in the final report.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="pass">Pass</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>After verifying that the requirements of a success criterion are satisfied, set its status to
								<i>pass</i>.</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/status_pass.png" width="330" alt="Status section showing the pass option set" />
						</figure>
						<p>Do not use the pass setting for success criteria that are not applicable to the content. For
							example, if the publication does not contain audio or video, do not pass it on success criteria
							for audio and video content. Doing so suggests that the publication contains content it does not.
							Use the <a href="#na">not applicable</a> status in these cases.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="fail">Fail</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>If the publication fails a success criterion, setting the status to <i>fail</i> will reveal a
							field to describe why it failed.</p>
						<figure>
							<figcaption>Clicking the fail status reveals the text field where you can note the
								failure(s)</figcaption>
							<img src="images/status_fail.png" width="330" alt="" />
						</figure>
						<p>Information added to this field is included in the generated report for the publication.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="na">N/A</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Set the status to "N/A" (not applicable) for any criteria that are not applicable to the
							publication.</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/status_na.png" width="330"
								alt="Status section showing the not applicable option set" />
						</figure>
						<p>Do not state that a publication passes criteria that are not applicable to its content, as this
							practice is misleading to anyone reading the final report.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<p>An optional note field is provided after the status section for recording any general notes you wish to
					provide. These notes are included in the generated report.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<figcaption>Clicking the "Add note" checkbox reveals the text field where you can write the
						note.</figcaption>
					<img src="images/notes.png" width="350" alt="" />
				</figure>
				
				<p>When checking each criterion, ensure that the publication meets all the specified requirements. Whenever
					possible, you will be directed where to look for potential problems so that you do not have to review
					the entire publication. This process typically involves referencing content lists in the Ace HTML report,
					such as the list of all images.</p>
				
				<p>In many cases, it will not be possible to help pinpoint potential error locations &#8212; you will have
					to inspect the source markup of the publication for errors. This is especially true for WCAG success criterion
					1.3.1, for example, which requires that information and relationships be expressed in the markup. Automatic 
					testing tools have limited capabilities for determining when a structure has been mistagged.</p>
				
				<p>Additional links are also provided to help you understand the various success criteria. These include direct
					links to the WCAG documentation, as well as links to markup best practices. If you are unsure about any aspect
					of a requirement, take the time to review these documents first.</p>
