				<h2>Verifying Conformance</h2>
				<section id="config">
					<h3>Configuration</h3>
					<p>The reporting tool is configured by default to verify that publications meets WCAG Level AA
						requirements.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/wcag_config.png" width="350"
							alt="WCAG conformance configuration with options for levels A and AA and a link to additional configuration settings"
						 />
					</figure>
					<p>To check for Level AA conformance, simply switch the setting. The list of success criteria to verify
						in the next step automatically updates to match the selected setting.</p>
					<p>The first section allows you to WCAG Level AA and AAA success criteria to the conformance verification
						tab.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/wcag_optional_config.png" width="350"
							alt="Configure button followed by save and load buttons" />
					</figure>
					<p>Showing these criteria does not change the conformance level being verified, and their status is not
						checked when the final report is generated. Showing them allows you to indicate that a publication
						meets requirements beyond the base level being tested. If any of these criteria are set to pass or
						fail, they will be included in the final report.</p>
					<div class="note">
						<p><strong>Note</strong>: To change the WCAG conformance level the publication has to meet, use the
								<a href="setup.html#wcag-config">options on the Start tab</a>.</p>
					</div>
					<p>It is also possible to hide content-specific success criteria if you know that they do not apply to
						the publication (e.g., scripting requirements).</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/criteria_options.png" width="450"
							alt="Checkboxes for images, audio, video, scripting, and forms elements" />
					</figure>
					<p>These options are automatically updated to reflect the content when the Ace JSON report is loaded in
						the <a href="setup.html">setup step</a>.</p>
					<p>Note that deselecting an option only hides the related criteria from view. The criteria are still
						included in the generated report with a "not applicable" status.</p>
					<div>
						<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The reporting tool does not include the option to conform to
							level AAA, as no content can realistically conform to all the requirements of this level.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section id="eval">
					<h3>Evaluating a Publication</h3>
					<p>The next, and primary, step in manually evaluating the publication is to check the required
						conformance requirements. The <a href="index.html#verification">Conformance Verification</a> tab
						provides a list of requirements that must be passed for each WCAG success criterion and each
						additional EPUB requirement.</p>
					<p>You will need to step through each success criterion and check that it is satisfied by the content.
						Each criterion includes a status section to simplify tracking the overall conformance, and to
						facilitate <a href="#generate">generating a report</a> at the end of the evaluation.</p>
					<figure>
						<figcaption>The status section appears after the links to the supporting documentation and includes
							pass, fail and not applicable options.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/status_unverified.png" width="350" alt="" />
					</figure>
					<p>The following list describes each of the status options.</p>
					<dl>
						<dt id="unverified">Unverified</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>All success criteria are set to <i>unverified</i> by default, although this status may be
								changed when the Ace JSON report is loaded and analyzed (e.g., some criteria might be set to
									<a href="#na">not applicable</a>).</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/status_unverified.png" width="350"
									alt="Status section showing the unverified option set" />
							</figure>
							<p>All success criteria for the conformance level specified in the <a href="setup.html"
									>evaluation setup</a> must be changed to one of the following status options prior to
								generating the final report. Failure to do so will result in a validation error. Note that
								Level AAA success criteria may be left unverified, in which case they will not be included in
								the final report.</p>
						</dd>

						<dt id="pass">Pass</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>After verifying that the requirements of a success criterion are satisfied, set its status to
									<i>pass</i>.</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/status_pass.png" width="350"
									alt="Status section showing the pass option set" />
							</figure>
							<p>Do not use the pass setting for success criteria that are not applicable to the content. For
								example, if the publication does not contain audio or video, do not pass it on success
								criteria for audio and video content. Doing so suggests that the publication contains content
								it does not. Use the <a href="#na">not applicable</a> status in these cases.</p>
						</dd>

						<dt id="fail">Fail</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>If the publication fails a success criterion, setting the status to <i>fail</i> will reveal a
								field to describe why it failed.</p>
							<figure>
								<figcaption>Clicking the fail status reveals the text field where you can note the
									failure(s)</figcaption>
								<img src="images/status_fail.png" width="500" alt="" />
							</figure>
							<p>Information added to this field is included in the generated report for the publication.</p>
						</dd>

						<dt id="na">N/A</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Set the status to "N/A" (not applicable) for any criteria that are not applicable to the
								publication.</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/status_na.png" width="350"
									alt="Status section showing the not applicable option set" />
							</figure>
							<p>Do not state that a publication passes criteria that are not applicable to its content, as
								this practice is misleading to anyone reading the final report.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>An optional note field is provided after the status section for recording any general notes you wish
						to provide. These notes are included in the generated report.</p>
					<figure>
						<figcaption>Clicking the "Add note" checkbox reveals the text field where you can write the
							note.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/notes.png" width="500" alt="" />
					</figure>
					<p>When checking each criterion, ensure that the publication meets all the specified requirements.
						Whenever possible, you will be directed where to look for potential problems so that you do not have
						to review the entire publication. This process typically involves referencing content lists in the
						Ace HTML report, such as the list of all images.</p>
					<p>In many cases, it will not be possible to help pinpoint potential error locations &#8212; you will
						have to inspect the source markup of the publication for errors. This is especially true for WCAG
						success criterion 1.3.1, for example, which requires that information and relationships be expressed
						in the markup. Automatic testing tools have limited capabilities for determining when a structure has
						been mistagged.</p>
					<p>Additional links are also provided to help you understand the various success criteria. These include
						direct links to the WCAG documentation, as well as links to markup best practices. If you are unsure
						about any aspect of a requirement, take the time to review these documents first.</p>
