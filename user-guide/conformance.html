				<h2>Verifying Conformance</h2>
				<p>The primary step in evaluating a publication is to verify it meets all the required conformance
					requirements. The Conformance Verification tab provides a list of requirements that must be passed for
					each WCAG success criterion and each additional EPUB requirement.</p>
				<section id="config">
					<h3>Configuration</h3>
					<p>The Conformance Verification tab is configured by default to verify that publications meets WCAG Level
						AA requirements.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/wcag_config.png" width="350"
							alt="WCAG conformance configuration with options for levels A and AA and a link to additional configuration settings"
						 />
					</figure>
					<p>To check Level A conformance instead, simply switch the setting. The list of success criteria
						automatically updates to match the selected setting.</p>
					<div class="note">
						<p><strong>Note</strong>: The reporting tool does not include the option to conform to level AAA as
							this level is more aspirational than achievable.</p>
					</div>
					<p>The next field allows you to add WCAG Level AA and AAA success criteria to the list to check.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/wcag_optional_config.png" width="350"
							alt="Configure button followed by save and load buttons" />
					</figure>
					<p>Showing these criteria does not change the conformance level being verified, and their status is not
						used in calculating the overall conformance. Showing the criteria simply allows you to indicate that
						a publication meets requirements beyond the base level being tested. Only criteria set to pass or
						fail are listed in the final report.</p>
					<p>It is also possible to hide content-specific success criteria if you know that they do not apply to
						the publication (e.g., scripting requirements).</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/criteria_options.png" width="450"
							alt="Checkboxes for images, audio, video, scripting, and forms elements" />
					</figure>
					<p>These options are automatically updated to reflect the content when the Ace JSON report is loaded in
						the <a href="setup.html">setup step</a>.</p>
					<p>Note that deselecting an option only hides the related criteria from view. The criteria are still
						included in the generated report with a "not applicable" status.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="eval">
					<h3>Evaluating a Publication</h3>
					<p>After configuring the evaluation, you have to step through each success criterion and check that it is
						satisfied by the content. When checking each criterion, ensure that the publication meets all the
						specified requirements.</p>
					<p>Whenever possible, you will be directed where to look for potential problems so that you do not have
						to review the entire publication (e.g., via the content lists in the Ace HTML report, such as the
						list of all images).</p>
					<p>More typically, it will not be possible to pinpoint potential error locations &#8212; you will have to
						inspect the source markup of the publication for errors. This is especially true for WCAG success
						criterion 1.3.1, for example, which requires that information and relationships be expressed in the
						markup. Automatic testing tools have limited capabilities for determining when a structure has been
						mistagged.</p>
					<p>Additional links are also provided to help you understand the various success criteria. These include
						direct links to the WCAG documentation, as well as links to markup best practices. If you are unsure
						about any aspect of a requirement, take the time to review these documents first.</p>
					<p>When you evaluate each criterion, set its status section to track overall conformance.</p>
					<figure>
						<figcaption>The status section appears after the links to the supporting documentation and includes
							pass, fail and not applicable options.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/status_unverified.png" width="350" alt="" />
					</figure>
					<p>The following list describes each of the status options.</p>
					<dl>
						<dt id="unverified">Unverified</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>All success criteria are set to <i>unverified</i> by default, although this status may be
								changed when the Ace JSON report is loaded and analyzed.</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/status_unverified.png" width="350"
									alt="Status section showing the unverified option set" />
							</figure>
							<p>All success criteria for the conformance level specified in the <a href="#config"
									>configuration options</a> must be changed to pass, fail or not applicable prior to
								generating the final report. Failure to do so will result in a validation error. Note that
								optional success criteria (i.e., those above the level being tested) may be left unverified,
								in which case they will not be included in the final report.</p>
						</dd>

						<dt id="pass">Pass</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>If the requirements of a success criterion are satisfied, set its status to <i>pass</i>.</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/status_pass.png" width="350"
									alt="Status section showing the pass option set" />
							</figure>
							<p>Do not use the pass setting for success criteria that are not applicable to the content. For
								example, if the publication does not contain audio or video, do not pass it on success
								criteria for audio and video content. Doing so suggests that the publication contains content
								it does not. Use the <a href="#na">not applicable</a> status in these cases.</p>
						</dd>

						<dt id="fail">Fail</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>If the publication fails a success criterion, setting the status to <i>fail</i> will reveal a
								field to describe why it failed.</p>
							<figure>
								<figcaption>Clicking the fail status reveals the text field where you can note the
									failure(s)</figcaption>
								<img src="images/status_fail.png" width="500" alt="" />
							</figure>
							<p>Failure notes are included in the final report for the publication by default, but can be
								excluded to create reports for different audiences (e.g., to provide more detail to a
								publisher about specific errors in the markup without revealing those details to a general
								audience).</p>
						</dd>

						<dt id="na">N/A</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Set the status to "N/A" (not applicable) for any criteria that are not applicable to the
								publication.</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/status_na.png" width="350"
									alt="Status section showing the not applicable option set" />
							</figure>
							<p>Do not state that a publication passes criteria that are not applicable to its content, as
								this practice is misleading to anyone reading the final report.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>An optional note field is provided after the status section for recording general conformance notes.
						These notes are included in the generated report by default, but can be excluded to create reports
						for different audiences.</p>
					<figure>
						<figcaption>Clicking the "Add note" checkbox reveals the text field where you can write the
							note.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/notes.png" width="500" alt="" />
