				<h2>Generating Reports</h2>
				
				<p>After completing all the evaluation steps, it is possible to generate a report based on your
					findings. This report can be included in the EPUB publication or hosted on the web and linked to
					from the publication.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<figcaption>Figure 1 &#8212; The Reporting tab is the sixth in the tab bar. It provides the
						options to preview and generate reports based on the evaluation and information
						entered.</figcaption>
					<img src="images/tab_report.png" width="700" alt="Report tab" />
				</figure>
				
				<p>There are two buttons for generating reports:</p>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>Preview</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Preview button opens the report in a new browser window so that you can review it.
							This page is only temporary and cannot be bookmarked or its link sent to other people.
							It only exists as long as you keep the window open.</p>
						
						<p>If any errors are encountered while compiling the report, you will receive an alert and the
							errors will be listed in a message panel at the bottom of the page.</p>
						
						<div class="note">
							<p><strong>Note</strong>: Although saving the source of the preview page is possible,
								it is not recommended. Browsers may inject their own markup and scripts.</p>
						</div>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Create</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Create button results in a prompt to download the report locally to your computer. Your
							browser may automatically save the file to a specific location, such as a Downloads folder,
							but this default can be changed so you can pick the location and name (search for
							instructions for your preferred browser).</p>
						
						<p>As with previews, if any errors are encountered while compiling the report, you will receive
							an alert and the errors will be listed in a message panel at the bottom of the page.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<section id="options">
					<h3>Output Options</h3>
					
					<p>The SMART tool allows some customization of the final reports in the output options.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<figcaption>Figure 2 &#8212; Expanding the Output Options field reveals additional
							configuration fields.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/report_notes.png" alt="Output options" width="450"/>
					</figure>
					
					
					<p>Currently, only the types of notes to include in the final report is customizable, allowing
						different levels of reports to be generated for different audiences.</p>
					
					<p>By default, all notes are included in the output. It is also possible to selectively include
						only the following messages:</p>
					
					<dl>
						<dt>Failure descriptions</dt>
						<dd>Failure descriptions are any messages input into the text field that automatically appears when
							a success criterion's status is set to Fail.</dd>
						
						<dt>Notes</dt>
						<dd>Notes are any messages input into the text field that automatically appears when the "Add note"
							checkbox for a success criterion is selected.</dd>
					</dl>
				</section>
				
				<section id="reports">
					<h3>Reports</h3>
					
					<p>The report documents are broken up into three tabs.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<figcaption>Figure 3 &#8212; An accessibility report page. It includes an overview,
							a conformance report, and additional information.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/a11y_report.png" alt="Smart report" width="600"/>
					</figure>
					
					<p>The default overview tab provides key information about the publication: its conformance
						status, the discoverability metadata, and who evaluated the publication.</p>
					
					<p>The conformance tab contains a complete list of the statuses of each success criterion, and
						the additional information tab lists more general metadata about the publication (e.g., the
						format and when it was last modified).</p>
