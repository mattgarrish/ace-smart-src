				<h2>Adapting to Workflows</h2>
				
				<p>You do not have to use all of the features of this tool in the evaluation of EPUB publications, and might
					not use any depending on your specific needs.</p>
				
				<p>Some of the ways your workflows might differ include:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>You might address accessibility requirements further upstream from the output, in which case some manual
						verification steps could be skipped by the evaluator (e.g., provision of alternative text and long
						descriptions for image assets).</li>
					
					<li>The storage and inclusion of metadata might not be a manual process, in which case those steps might be
						skipped or the necessary information might be included in the final product some other way;</li>
					
					<li>You might not provide reports for each publication you produce or you might have your own reporting
						template, in which case there is no need to fill out the manual conformance fields;</li>
					
					<li>Your evaluators may already be sufficiently proficient with WCAG evaluations that they do not need to
						cross-check against the tool.</li>
