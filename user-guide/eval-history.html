				<h2>Evaluation History</h2>
				
				<p>Your evaluation history is available from the start page after you log in. It is provided in a
					table below the section to <a href="load-ace.html">start new evaluations</a>.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<figcaption>Figure 1 &#8212; Evaluation history table with three entries. A box to filter

				</figure>
				
				<p>The columns of the table provide the following information about the evaluations:</p>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>Title</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The title column shows the publication title that was found when the Ace report metadata was
							loaded, or that was specified for a blank evaluation. (It is currently not possible to
							change the title after loading.)</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Started</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The started column shows the date and time when you first started the evaluation.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Last Saved</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The last saved column shows the date and time when you last saved the evaluation. If the
							field has the value "0000-00-00 00:00:00", it indicates that the evaluation was never saved
							or that it has been deleted (for remotely saved evaluations).</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Status</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The status column identifies the last known action taken. It will have one of the following
							values:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Saved &#8212; the file was last saved to the SMART server.</li>
							<li>Saved Locally &#8212; the file was last saved to your computer.</li>
							<li>Deleted &#8212; the evaluation data was deleted from the SMART server.</li>
							<li>Unsaved &#8212; the evaluation has not yet been, or was not, saved.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Options</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The options column provides one or buttons to manage your evaluation. Depending on the
							current status, you will be provided buttons to <a href="eval-resume.html">resume the
								evaluation</a> and/or <a href="eval-delete.html">delete the evaluation</a>.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<p>By default, the table is ordered so that evaluations are listed from the most recently started to
					the oldest. Clicking on any of the column headers will re-order the table by that field.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<figcaption>Figure 2 &#8212; The evaluation history table is sorted so that the entries are
						listed alphabetically by title.</figcaption>

				</figure>
				
				<p>There is also a search box at the top of the table that will filter the evaluations to only
					those that match the text you enter.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<figcaption>Figure 3 &#8212; The text "acce" is entered in the filter field so only the
						"Accessible EPUB 3" evaluation appears in the history table.</figcaption>
