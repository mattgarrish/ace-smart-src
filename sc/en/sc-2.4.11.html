	<p>The fastest way to determine whether this success criterion applies to an EPUB publication
		is to check any CSS files for <code>:focus</code> selectors. If none are found, then the
		author has no overridden the reading system defaults and this success criterion can be
		marked as not applicable.</p>
	
	<p>If <code>:focus</code> selectors are found, then their usage in the content needs to be
		verified. Open the EPUB publication and use the keyboard to tab to elements that are
		affected by the selector. If focus is indicated by a solid line that completely encloses
		the element, and there is a 3:1 contrast ratio between the outline and both the pixels it
		was drawn over and its adjacent pixels then success criterion passes.</p>

	<p>If the focus selector does not fully enclose the element, or does not use a solid line
		as an indicator, then it must either:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>at least as large as the area of a 1 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused
			component; or</li>
		<li>at least as large as a 4 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest side of a minimum
			bounding box of the unfocused component.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The first bullet requires calculating the perimeter around the element. The focus indicator
		must then be at least this big. For example, if the element is a 200 by 50 button, a 1-pixel
		perimeter equals 498 pixels. The area of the focus indicator must then be at least this big.
		It can be any shape and does not have to be solid, but the total area it occupies must be
		at least 498 pixels (e.g., the focus indicator could take the shape of a box within the
		perimeter of the element but thicker than 1 pixel so it occupies a greater area). Calculating
		conformance can be tricky, especially when dashes and dots are used.</p>
	
	<p>The second bullet requires a similar area calculation. In this case, the shortest edge of the
		element is multiplied by 4. The area of the focus indicator then needs to occupy at least
		the same area. Using the previous example, of a button with a 50-pixel short edge, the focus
		indicator would have to occupy at least 200 pixels.</p>
