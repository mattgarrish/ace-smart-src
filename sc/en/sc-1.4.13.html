<div class="sc-body">
	<p>If the publication has any content that only appears for a mouse hover or keyboard focus event (e.g.,
		tooltips using the <code>title</code> attribute or dropdown menus), ensure the following are all
		true:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You can dismiss the content without having to change the mouse position or change the keyboard focus
			(e.g., using the escape key).</li>
		<li>If a hover event triggers the content, you can move the mouse over the hovered content without it
			disappearing.</li>
		<li>The content remains visible until you dismiss it, move the mouse away, tab to another element, or it
			is no longer relevant (e.g., in the case of temporary messages).</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: This success criterion is not often applicable to EPUB publications as they are
		generally designed to be read in devices without pointer inputs and keyboards.</p>
