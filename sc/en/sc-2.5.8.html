<div class="sc-body">
	<p>Every target (e.g., links, buttons) in an EPUB publication, must be at least 24 pixels by 24 pixels in
		size.</p>
	<p>If a target does not meet this minimum size, the success criterion can still pass if one of the following
		is true:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The target is inline in a block of text. This exception means that links in paragraphs are exempt,
			for example, and do not need to be checked. (Note that lists of links would not fall under this
			exception.)</li>
		<li>When there are adjacent targets, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-target-offsets"
				>target offset</a> (the distance from one edge of the target to the next) is at least 24 pixels.
			The offset is measured from the furthest edge of the target to the nearest edge of the adjacent
			target.</li>
		<li>The positioning of the targets is essential to the information being conveyed (e.g., targets on a
			map cannot be moved).</li>
		<li>The target is a native HTML control that has not been modified by the author.</li>
		<li>There is another control in the same document that provides the same functionality and meets the
			sizing requirement.</li>
	</ul>
