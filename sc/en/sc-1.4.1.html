	<p>Verify that there are alternatives to color where the content makes use of the perception of colour to
		convey meaning or purpose (e.g., in order to understand the different pieces of a chart, to determine
		what controls to use in a scripted interface, or to identify hyperlinks from regular text).</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: This success criterion only covers the needs of sighted users who are color blind
		or have difficult perceiving color (i.e., the alternatives for color-dependent content must be visible,
		such as the addition of underline or bolding for hyperlinks).</p>
