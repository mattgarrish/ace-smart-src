	<p>Check if the publication - not the reading system - requires the user to log in to perform any actions

		remember a password or repeat a gesture pattern) unless one of the following is true:</p>

		<li>there is an alternative means of logging in that does not require such a test;</li>
		<li>there is a mechanism to help the user perform the test (e.g., if a reading system allows users to

		<li>the cognitive function test only requires the user to recognize an object (e.g., to select an image

		<li>the cognitive function test only requires the user to recognize non-textual content that the user
