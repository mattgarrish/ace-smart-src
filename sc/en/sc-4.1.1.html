<div class="sc-body">
	<p>Verify the publication passes EPUBCheck (or a similar EPUB validator) without any of the following
		errors:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Well-formedness errors — All required start and end tags are present.</li>
		<li>Nesting errors — Elements must only be used where they are valid (e.g., list items inside of
			lists).</li>
		<li>Duplicate attributes — Elements are only allowed one instance of any attribute.</li>
		<li>Duplicate IDs — Each ID in a document must be unique.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is recommended to fix all errors reported by EPUBCheck to ensure maximum usability of the publication
		but it is not a requirement for accessibility.</p>
