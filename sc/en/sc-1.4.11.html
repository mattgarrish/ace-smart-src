<div class="sc-body">
	<p>Check if the publication uses any icons to convey information. Common examples in books include icons
		that identify sidebars, such as an exclamation point for warning and cautions, a pencil for learning
		objectives, etc.</p>
	<p>If any such icons are found, ensure that there is at least 3:1 contrast between the symbol and the colour
		adjacent to it.</p>
	<p>The same check also needs to be performed for any diagrams, charts, infographics, and other visual
		content that conveys information. If any of these images use graphical components as the sole means of
		conveying the information (e.g., a pie chart that shows slices but does not explicitly indicate the size
		of each), each component must have a 3:1 contrast with the adjacent coloring.</p>
	<p>In addition, verify that any form fields also meet this requirement. For example, that there is
		sufficient contrast between the borders of text input fields and the adjacaent color, around buttons,
		and for radio buttons and checkboxes.</p>
