<div class="sc-body">
	<p>If any images contain text, check if the presentation can be achieved without an image (e.g., through CSS
		or table markup).</p>
	<p>If the presentation cannot be achieved without an image, this success criterion passes.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: This success criterion does not apply to images where the presentation is essential
		(e.g., logos) or where the text can be controlled separately from the image (e.g., SVG). It also does
		not apply to graphs and diagrams where more than just the text is essential information.</p>
