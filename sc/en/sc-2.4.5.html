	<p>There must be at least two ways that allow a user can navigate through the content. EPUB publications
		minimally meets this requirement if all content documents are listed in the spine and there is a
		navigation document with links to the major sections.</p>
	<p>The addition of a page list or index can also be counted in meeting this criterion.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: The inclusion of landmarks should not be considered when evaluating this criterion,
		although they are important to include. Users only have access to these landmarks through the
		functionality provided by a given reading system; there isn't broad support for users to access the
		links directly.</p>
