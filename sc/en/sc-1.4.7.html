	<p>Verify at least one of the following is true for all prerecorded audio-only content:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The audio does not contain background sounds.</li>
		<li>The background sounds can be turned off.</li>
		<li>The background sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than the foreground speech content, with the
			exception of occasional sounds that last for only one or two seconds.</li>

		primarily musical expression (e.g., singing or rapping).</p>
