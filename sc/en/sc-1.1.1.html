			<p>For each image:</p>

				<li id="img-non-empty">
					<p>If the image is decorative, ensure it has an empty <code>alt</code> attribute
						(<code>alt=""</code>). A decorative image is one that does not contain
						information the user needs to be aware of; it only exists to make the
						publication more visually appealing. Common examples include: ornamental
						graphics around chapter numbers and headings, and stock imagery found at the
						beginning of chapters or used to illustrate points being made in the text.</p>

					<p>If the image is not decorative and has an empty <code>alt</code> attribute, one

					<ul>
						<li>its <code>figcaption</code> element or the surrounding text must describe
							the image;</li>
						<li>the image must be part of a group of images in which only one carries the
							alternative text.</li>

				<li>
					<p>Otherwise, ensure that the <code>alt</code> text meaningfully describes the
