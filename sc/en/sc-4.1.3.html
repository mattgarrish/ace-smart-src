<div class="sc-body">
	<p>Check if any interactive content emits status messages. For example, invalid input in a form might cause
		a warning message to appear beside the input.</p>
	<p>Any such status messages must be identified using ARIA roles and/or properties so that assistive
		technologies can announce them. Typically this is done by pairing a <a
			href="https://w3c.github.io/aria/#live_region_roles">live region role</a> together with the
			<code>aria-live</code> attribute to control when the message is read.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: This success criterion does not apply to dialogs and similar alerts that receive
		automatic focus.</p>
