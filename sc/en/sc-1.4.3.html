<div class="sc-body">
	<p>Verify the following are true:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If the publications contains SVG images, check that any text in them meets the 4.5:1 contrast
			requirement.</li>
		<li>If the publication contains images of text, check that the text meet the 4.5:1 contrast
			requirement.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If the Ace tool has not been run on the publication, the contrast of all text content also needs to be
		checked.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: Contrast is the difference in luminance between the colors of the text and
		background.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: An image of text is exempt from this requirement if it is part of an inactive
		interface, is purely decorational, is not visible, or is part of a brand or logo. If the text in the
		image is incidental information, it is also exempt (e.g., road or store signs in a landscape
		picture).</p>
