<div class="sc-body">
	<p>If there is content that opens over the text, such as a pop-up, check that
		it does not completely obscure any focusable elements, such as links, inputs, etc.
		So long as part of the focus indicator is visible, the publication passes.</p>
	<p>For content like pop-ups, this success criterion only applies to its default position
		when opened. Being able to obscure focusable elements by moving the content is not
		a failure.</p>
	<p>Note that this success criterion does not apply to modal dialogs (i.e., pop-ups that
		you must dismiss before you can continue reading). It also does not apply to functionality
		provided by the reading system (e.g., pop-up footnotes).</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: This success criterion rarely applies to EPUB publications because having
		content overlay the text typically does not work with reading system pagination (e.g., sticky
		headers and footers could only work in a scrolling environment).</p>
