	<p>If the publication includes instructions for understanding or operating the content, verify the
		instructions do not depend solely on sensory perception (e.g., selecting an object by its colour, shape,
		size, position, etc.).</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: Content does not fail this success criterion simply because it employs colours,
		shapes, sizes, etc. A sidebar identifiable by background shading is not a failure unless there are
		instructions to review only certain coloured sidebars, for example. Requirements for semantic tagging
		are covered by <a href="#sc-1.3.1">1.3.1</a>.</p>
