	<p>Check if there are any video clips whose accompanying audio does not fully describe all the visual
		information (e.g., omits actions being carried out by a presenter).</p>
	
	<p>If yes, verify one of the following is true for each:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A <code>track</code> element includes an audio description (<code>kind="descriptions"</code>), or
			the audio includes descriptions by default.</li>
		<li>The author has provided a transcript with the descriptions.</li>
