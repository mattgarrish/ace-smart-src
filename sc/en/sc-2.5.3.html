	<p>If the publication has inputs or controls with visible labels (i.e., that sighted users can see), the
		name of the control must be the same as the visible text. (The name of an input or control is defined in
		the <code>label</code> element for it, or, if not specified, in an <code>aria-label</code>,
			<code>title</code>, or <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute on the element).</p>
