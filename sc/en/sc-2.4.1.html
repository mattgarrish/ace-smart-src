<div class="sc-body">
	<p>If identical content is repeated at the beginning of every content document, there must be a way to
		bypass the duplicate information.</p>
	<p>Although this problem is typically rare in EPUB publication, one place it may be encountered is with
		running headers and footers in fixed-layout publications. In these cases, the HTML <code>header</code>
		and <code>footer</code> elements can be used to encapsulate the running header/footer and the
			<code>main</code> element can be used to encapsulate the body.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: This success criterion typically is aimed at web site navigation, to allow users to
		bypass repeated site headers, navigation bars, etc.</p>
