<div class="sc-body">
	<p>Ensure that there is a minimum 7:1 contrast ratio for all text in the publication and images of text.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: Contrast is the difference in luminance between the colors of the text and
		background. It is recommended to use an automated tool to check this success criterion. Ace only checks
		contrasts up to 4.5:1, and does not verify images of text, so a passing report does not indicate
		conformance to this success criterion.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: An image of text is exempt from this requirement if it is part of an inactive
		interface, is purely decorational, is not visible, or is part of a brand or logo. If the text in the
		image is incidental information, it is also exempt (e.g., road or store signs in a landscape
		picture).</p>
