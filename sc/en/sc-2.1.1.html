<div class="sc-body">
	<p>Verify that all interactive content (scripted components, forms, audio, video, links, etc.) can be
		controlled by keyboard.</p>
	<p>An exception is made for interactive content where the full path of movement (from start of movement to
		end) is essential to its operation.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: An example of an application that requires the full path of movement is a drawing
		program. Drag and drop applications are not exempt, on the other hand, as the path taken to the endpoint
		is not essential.</p>
	<p>In addition, verify that operation is not dependent on specific timings of keystrokes (e.g., that keys
		must be pressed a certain number of times in an interval, or held down for a set period of time).</p>
