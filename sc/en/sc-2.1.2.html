<div class="sc-body">
	<p>Verify that any interactive content (scripted components, forms, audio, video etc.) does not present a
		keyboard trap.</p>
	<p>A keyboard trap results when an application can be entered using the keyboard but then cannot be escaped
		using the same method (e.g., can be tabbed into but then the tab key has a different function within the
		application).</p>
	<p>If any content cannot be escaped from once entered using the typical escape key, there must be
		instructions on how to escape.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: Audio and video content that uses native HTML controls (i.e., has the
			<code>controls</code> attribute set by default) can be assumed to be accessible. If the author has
		scripted their own controls, the interface needs testing.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: Plugins are a common cause of keyboard traps. Although formats that require a
		plugin are not typically found in EPUB 3, some EPUB 2 reading systems supported Flash video.</p>
