<div class="sc-body">
	<p>Zoom the content so that it is no more than 320 pixels wide and 256 pixels high (this is equal to 400%
		zoom on a device screen that is 1280 pixels wide by 1024 high).</p>
	<p>Check that horizontal and vertical scrolling is not required to read the text.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: This requirement does not apply to visual media that requires two-dimensional
		layout, such as video, diagrams, maps, etc. It is also only recommended (but not required) that the
		content within table cells not require scrolling when zoomed, not that the entire table be viewable
		without scrolling.</p>
	<p>For fixed layouts, while background images may be exempt, the text content of the page must reflow when
		zoomed.</p>
