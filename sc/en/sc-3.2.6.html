	<p class="sc-note">Note: This success criterion is designed to make finding help information for a web site
		consistent. It is not meant to be applied to contextual help within the content (e.g., help with an
		embedded quiz or how to fill in form fields). Consequently, its applicability to publications is suspect
		given that the documents in publications do not have repeated site headers, footers, etc. Evaluators
		should just mark this success criterion not applicable.</p>
	<p>For information on how to evaluate this success criterion, refer to the <a
