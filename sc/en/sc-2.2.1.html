<div class="sc-body">
	<p>If a time limit is set by any of the content (e.g., in dynamic quizzes or games), verify that at least
		one of the following is true:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it.</li>
		<li>The user is allowed to adjust the time limit, before encountering it, over a range that is at least
			ten times the length of the default.</li>
		<li>The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a
			simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit
			at least ten times.</li>
		<li>The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative
			to the time limit is possible.</li>
		<li>The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity.</li>
		<li>The time limit is longer than 20 hours.</li>
