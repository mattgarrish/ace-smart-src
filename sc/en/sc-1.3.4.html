	<p>Check that the publication is not locked to reading in only one device orientation.</p>
	<p>In addition, ensure that changing the orientation does not cause issues with resizing the text (see <a
			href="#sc-1.4.4">success criteria 1.4.4</a>).</p>
	<p>This success criterion is most often an issue with fixed layout publication. Reflowable EPUBs should
		adapt to changes in orientation.</p>
