<div class="sc-body">
	<p>Change the text display of the content as follows:</p>
	<p> </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Set the line height to 1.5 times the font height.</li>
		<li>Set the spacing after paragraphs to 2 times the font height.</li>
		<li>Set the letter spacing to 0.12 times the font height.</li>
		<li>Set word spacing to 0.16 times the font height.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now check that the text is not cut off (e.g., when in an aside or other box) or overlapping.</p>
	<p>If any of these properties are not applicable to a specific language (e.g., word spacing to Japanese,
		Korean and Chinese), they do not have to be tested.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: This success criterion will likely require testing in a browser as reading systems
		provide limited control over these properties.</p>
