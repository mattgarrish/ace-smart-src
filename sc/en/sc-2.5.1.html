<div class="sc-body">
	<p>Check if the publication contains any functionality that depends on multipoint gestures (i.e., where the
		different points along the gesture change the effect, meaning, or value). Some examples include: swiping
		and picking from a carousel of images, pinching to zoom an interactive map, or dragging a slider right
		or left.</p>
	<p>If yes, each control must include an simple point and click alternative. For example, a slider might have
		plus and minus buttons to control its value, or am interactive map might have a manual zoom control.</p>
	<p>This success criterion does not apply to path-based gestures that control the reading system interface
		(e.g., pinching to zoom the publication or swiping to turn pages). Native HTML controls are also exempt
		(e.g., audio and video playback and volume controls).</p>
