				<h2>What's New</h2>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>May 18, 2023 &#8212; Adding evaluator metadata associations</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The evaluator metadata generated in the Result tab now includes associations
							between the fields. The evaluator is linked to the conformance result, and
							the evaluator's credential and report is linked to them.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>May 18, 2023 &#8212; Added certifier credential field</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Result tab now includes a field for inputting a credential. This metadata
							is currently only used to generate metadata for the EPUB package document, but
							its use may be expanded to the final reports in the future.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>November 18, 2022 &#8212; Experimental support for WCAG 2.2</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>SMART now supports evaluating EPUB publications against the <a 
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/CR-WCAG22-20220906/">WCAG 2.2 Candidate Recommendation</a>.
							Evaluators are advised to only use this option for experimentation at this time, however.
							WCAG 2.2 may change again before becoming a final recommendation.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>October 26, 2022 &#8212; Unlimited access</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>We have removed the restriction on creating reports for non-
							<a href="https://daisy.org/about-us/membership/inclusive-publishing-partners/">Inclusive
								Publishing Partner</a> members. SMART is now available without restriction to everyone.</p>
						<p>Existing accounts that were restricted to two reports a month have been migrated to unlimited
							access. It is not necessary to create a new account.
						<p>The login page has also been updated to better introduce the tool to users.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>August 15, 2022 &#8212; Updated EPUB Accessibility 1.1 support</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The EPUB Accessibility 1.1 specification made a couple of significant changes during the
							Candidate Recommendation phase. The conformance statement made in the
							<code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> property now uses a more human-readable pattern. The
							<code>accessibilitySummary</code> property was also changed from required to recommended
							to include.</p>
						<p>The SMART tool now incorporates these changes in the experimental support for the
							standard.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>August 15, 2022 &#8212; Ace support updated</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The SMART tool now handles errors from the aXe 4.4 rule set reported by Ace.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 11, 2022 &#8212; Support for EPUB Accessibility 1.1</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Ace SMART now includes support for evaluating EPUB publications against the new Accessibility 1.1
							specification!</p>
						<p>On the Conformance tab, you can now select the 1.1 specification from the options at the top
							to begin an evaluation. Selecting this version will also allow you to change the WCAG
							conformance field to 2.1. SMART has also been updated to output the new conformance
							strings for Accessibility 1.1 specification.
						<p>This feature is still considered experimental as the specification is not yet a W3C Recommendation
							(i.e., it is still possible that it will change).</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 11, 2022 &#8212; New statistics box</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Conformance tab now includes a statistic box that reports how many success criteria have
							passed, failed, are not applicable, and have not yet been checked. This box remains fixed as
							the page scrolls.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 11, 2022 &#8212; New ONIX values</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Distribution tab now includes support for ONIX Code List 196 values 25 through 29 and
							93.</p>
					</dd>
