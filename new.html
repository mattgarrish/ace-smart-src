				<h2>What's New</h2>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>August 15, 2022 &#8212; Updated EPUB Accessibility 1.1 support</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The EPUB Accessibility 1.1 specification made a couple of significant changes during the
							Candidate Recommendation phase. The conformance statement made in the
							<code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> property now uses a more human-readable pattern. The
							<code>accessibilitySummary</code> property was also changed from required to recommended
							to include.</p>
						<p>The SMART tool now incorporates these changes in the experimental support for the
							standard.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>August 15, 2022 &#8212; Ace support updated</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The SMART tool now handles errors from the aXe 4.4 rule set reported by Ace.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 11, 2022 &#8212; Support for EPUB Accessibility 1.1</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Ace SMART now includes support for evaluating EPUB publications against the new Accessibility 1.1
							specification!</p>
						<p>On the Conformance tab, you can now select the 1.1 specification from the options at the top
							to begin an evaluation. Selecting this version will also allow you to change the WCAG
							conformance field to 2.1. SMART has also been updated to output the new conformance
							strings for Accessibility 1.1 specification.
						<p>This feature is still considered experimental as the specification is not yet a W3C Recommendation
							(i.e., it is still possible that it will change).</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 11, 2022 &#8212; New statistics box</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Conformance tab now includes a statistic box that reports how many success criteria have
							passed, failed, are not applicable, and have not yet been checked. This box remains fixed as
							the page scrolls.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 11, 2022 &#8212; New ONIX values</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Distribution tab now includes support for ONIX Code List 196 values 25 through 29 and
							93.</p>
					</dd>
